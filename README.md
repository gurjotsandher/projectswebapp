This is our projectswebapp. Some of us had a couple issues pushing, pulling, cloning, etc from github
so we did a lot of our VCS on our own using multiple folders and heavy use of Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y. 

We uploaded onto Github in accordance to the work we did to provide records for our instructor Carly. We
did this to gain practice in using a VCS and familiarize ourselves with the cmds.

In total we each believe that all group members contributed their fullest efforts. The work submitted can be
described as equity.

Edit1: We transferred files to each other via USB, we did most of our work together in person and not
remotely. It was primitive but effective.
