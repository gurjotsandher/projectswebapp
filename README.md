This is our projectswebapp. Some of us had a couple issues pushing, pulling, cloning, etc from github
so we did a lot of our VCS on our own using multiple folders and heavy use of Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y. We
uploaded onto Github in accordance to the work we did to provide records for our instructor Carly.
In total we each believe that all group members contributed their fullest efforts. The work submitted can be
described as equity.
